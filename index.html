             <h2>Acoustic Guitar</h2>
             <p>Acoustic guitars are ideal for beginner guitarists and singer-songwriters who want something to strum and/or fingerpick their songs on.
                They’re not so ideal for players looking to bust out big, screaming, distortion heavy solos. For that, see electric guitars.</p>

             <h2>Electric Guitar</h2>
             <p>Electric guitars are ideal for players who seek a powerful, sustaining sound or who want a much greater choice of sounds.
                With an electric guitar the world of effect pedals is open to you and the sounds you can create are almost limitless.</p>

             <h2>Acoustic-Electric Guitar</h2>
             <p>Semi-acoustic guitars are ideal for players who want versatility. Something they can get an acoustic-esque tone with, but also play through a cranked up amplifier should they wish. 
                They’re not so ideal for people who want one or the other. (i.e., a fully acoustic sound or a fully electric sound.)</p>
